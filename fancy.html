        <h2 class="ctr">Requirements for access</h2>
      </a>
      <div class="ins">
	    <div class="body end">
          <p class="br">The three requirements for being able to purpose the QR codes shown in cia-files🎮 is relatively simple;</p>
          <ul class="br">
            <li>Be in Dandelion Way</li>
            <li>Have a modded console</li>
            <li>Know how to purpose them</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="br">It is already assumed, if you have gained access to cia-files🎮 you satisfy the first two requirements. The last of which is what this guide will teach you to do.</p>
		  <h3>What <i>are</i> QR codes, exactly?</h3>
		  <p class="br">Originally a matrix barcode standard created in 1994 for Japan's automotive industry, it has seen prevalence worldwide due to its capacity to store a lot of information in not a lot fo space. Because of this, and because as images, barcodes are generally considered safe to use in data exchanges (as they are only images after all) it is the standard we use in Dandelion Way as a means of distributing game images packed as CIA files.</p>
		  <p>Mind, that doesn't mean the QQR coe is for the whole game; These codes are foe file locations where you can receive a title; these codes to not give the full game, only a reference to it. Once received, it can then be installed using FBI in your 3DS, or it can be received directly through FBI per recent updates.</p>
        </div>
	  </div>
      <a class="item section" id="title2">
        <h2 class="ctr">How to use</h2>
      </a>
      <div class="ins">
        <div class="body end">
          <p>There are a variety of ways to handle this, so let's go over methods for scanning and receiving one step at a time;</p>
		  <h3>Purposing QR codes</h3>
		  <p>There are several options for doing just that, with the easiest of the methods shown first;</p>
		  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
		    <li><b><u class="br">Using your console</u></b><p>Via FBI, you can select the option <i>Remote Install</i>, then select <i>Scan QR code</i> to acquire a title, but it requires your Internet connection last long enough or possess enough data to handle receiving the data. This is best done with a high-capacity or unlimited plan, or via a connection you know won't be penalized for its use.</p></li>
			<li><b><u class="br">Using a web service</u></b><p>Various web services exist which allow you to right-click (or control-click) a QR code, as they are just pictures to most utilities, though web services will convert the data the image contains into a web address you can then access through your web browser.</p></li>
			<li><b><u class="br">Using a mobile handset camera</u></b><p>The rear-ward facing camera on most mobile handsets ("Smartphones") usually work pretty well for this task, with a multitude of applications designed to scan various codes. <i>However</i> the problem with that is sometimes the camera sensor receives too much light, thus the image ebcomes blown out and unusable. The one primary advantage of this method is it's more socially-acceptable to whip out your phone rather than your 3DS, and some code scanning apps may also have a decode history you can scroll through to download on-the-go or using another Internet connection.</p></li>
		  </ol>
		  <h3>Transferring contents to your console's external storage</h3>
		  <p>If you cannot use your console to scan the code, then you <i>will</i> have to do this. there are a few ways this can be done;</p>
		  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
		    <li><b><u class="br">Using a device's internal (micro) SD card interface</u></b><p>If you use a new 3DS or old 3DS with a microSD card adapter, you can use just about anything with a microSD card interface, however if you are using a full-size SD card in your old 3DS, your options are limited to tablets and desktop PCs with a full-size SD card interface. This is the fastest way to transfer an image, however you also need to be around the device you are using for this to work.</p></li>
			<li><b><u class="br">Using an external interface</u></b><p>If your smartphone lacks an SD card interface <i>but</i> so happens to have USB on-the-go support, you can use USB OTG adapters to transfer data onto a (micro)SD card. Some laptops are also not including SD card interfaces so if your PC was not made during SecureDisk's golden era where it  reigned supreme over compact flash and was standard functionality, you will need to use a USB host controller on-board or externally via ExpressCard<sup>*</sup> to transfer CIA images to your console's SD card.</p><p><small>Yes, I know ExpressCard isn't even standard anymore, this information was included for completeness, and there may also be SD card adapters for older laptops with the ExpressCard interface, thus making the USB interface not necessary.</small></p></li>
			<li><b><u class="br">Via File Transfer Protocol</u></b><p>Once modified, a console's external storage can be manipulated via FTP, rather than CIFS which Microsoft depreciated so long ago. If you can use microSD Management on a new 3DS, <i>go for it</i> but if not because your system disallows it, or you don't have a system which even offers that as an option then you will need an FTP client, such as FileZilla (for lack of other cross-system compatible examples) and an FTP server on your 3DS, such as FTPD.</p></li>
		  </ol>
		  <h3>Installing the game</h3>
		  <p class="br">This is fairly simple, and both options can be done via FBI;</p>
		  <ol>
		    <li><b><u class="br">Remote install</u></b><p>If you chose to scan a QR code, you're already set; once received, FBI will install the game via its CIA image for you.</p>
			<li><b><u class="br">From external storage</u></b><p>If you had to use a separate device so the CIA file can be put onto the 3DS' external storage, then selecting the <i>SD</i> option will allow yout o install a CIA file. It does not matter where the image is, so long you are able to find it. You can even put a whole bunch of images onto an SD card and use the <i>&lt;Current directory&gt;</i> option to install them all at once; so long a CIA image is in there, options for handling CIA images are presented.</p>
		  </ol>
        </div>
      </div>
	  
      <a class="item section" id="title3">
        <h2 class="ctr">How to generate</h2>
      </a>
      <div class="ins">
        <div class="body">
          <p>Have a game you'd like to share? Want to make it easier for your peers to receive? FOllow these steps first;</p>
		  <ul class="br">
		    <li>Find a game you want to share</li>
			<li>Click through whatever for-profit shorteners are used</li>
			<li>Right-click on a file's download button and copy its link.</li>
		  </ul>
          <p class="br">If you cannot share a game directly, feel free to re-upload it! Once you have a URL which is a direct link to the CIA file, you can then codify it using a QR code generator of your choice, however, there are several rules regarding it;</p>
		  <ol class="br">
		    <li>Avoid fancy effects; keep 'em plain</li>
			<li>Do not attempt to personalize with your present avatar, 2D game icon or game logo</li>
			<li>Do not make them dynamic; there's no need to add another layer of obscurity</li>
		  </ol>
		  <p>Once you have your QR code, you might notice it's a bit large around the edges; this is a "Safe zone" that allows you to put a digital camera's viewfinder in place while taking a picture for decoding, however as some websites had proven previously it doesn't need to be so big, so to shrink it up use a utility like the GNU Image Manipulation Program.</p>
		  <h3>Generation parameters</h3>
		  <p>For legibility, the QR code should have low error tolerance (as these are not being printed) and rendered at a medium size. Any larger and they would take up <i>far</i> too much space, any higher error correction will yield a more dense image; larger in size, but occupying the same space which may make scanning more difficult.</p>

		    <h3 class="nobr">Touching up in GIMP</h3>
			<p class="br">
              <!--Break for consistency.-->
            </p>
		    <p class="br">This is very simple to do for even novice users of the program to figure out on their own, but with GIMP (or GIMP portable) installed you can do the following;</p>
			<ol class="br">
		      <li>Zoom in and measure one of the blocks with box select</li>
			  <li>Measure again, this time from the outer edge of the image to the outer edge of the QR data</li>
			  <li>Subtract from the outer border measure the block measure</li>
			  <li>Use box select to select all, or invoke select all with pressing <code>A</code> while holding <code>[Ctrl]</code></li>
			  <li>From the <i>Select</i> menu, choose to shrink selection</li>
			  <li>Shrink with the sum received from the subtraction equated (and maybe multiply by two, whatever you like)</li>
			  <li>Cut the selection, then paste as a new image by pressing <code>V</code> while holding <code>[Shift]</code> and <code>[Ctrl]</code></li>
			  <li><i>Export</i> the image, as a format Discord accepts</li>
		    </ol>
		    <p>Sound complicated? It's not, really; If the gap on all sides is 22px, and the block size is 5px, you can then shrink the selection by 17px and shrink the code by 34px on all sides. This effort not only saves on space, but also saves on disk space when storing them en masse.</p>
		    <h3>Other space-saving measures</h3>
		    <p class="br">If you'd like to store a whole bunch of these, there are other space-saving measures you can take while editing the image which may be worthwhile, potentially shrinking the file size to below 1 megabyte each;</p>
		    <ul class="br">
		      <li>Changing the image mode from RGB to indexed, 1-bit</li>
			  <li>Enabling <i>none</i> of the options in PNG format</li>
			  <li>JPEG compression may also help if you crank that up to max</li>
			  <li>(2.10 only) Saving as 8bpc GRAY and <i>not</i> saving extra data with the image</li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>All of this effort means if in the future you want to share any of these images with friends on other platforms, or if you are just hoarding these reference links to other games for yourself you can save a whole bunch of space over time with following the above advice.</p>

		  <p>When sharing your QR code in Discord, if you only have one then you can just paste from the clipboard of whatever page or program you copied the image from and append it with the following text in the image sharing dialogue;</p>
		  <p class="br"><code>**$TITLE ($R)**</code></p>
		  <P>If whatever title you are sharing has updates and DLC, it is recommended to share those in Discord for Mobile, as multiple images shared there will show as one big post for an end-user on the desktop version. This is also important for quality-of-life improvements shown in the next section. When sharing through mobile use the following for message input:</p>
		  <p class="br"><code>**$TITLE ($R; $FILE1, $FILE2, $FILE3)**</code></p>
		  <p class="br">Fill in the following information by adjusting the variables as shown;</p>
		  <ul class="txtli br">
		    <li><code>$TITLE</code>: Name of the title you are sharing</li>
			<li><code>$R</code>: Title's region (USA, EUR, JPN)</li>
			<li><code>$FILE1</code>: The title itself (usually the only image)</li>
			<li><code>$FILE2</code>: The title's secondary content (Usually an update)</li>
			<li><code>$FILE3</code>: The title's tertiary content (usually DLC)</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p class="br">If you are using Discord for mobile and (transferred your) saved images to your mobile, then using your handset's file manager (if applicable) to rename the images can help influence sharing order. From what has been observed, Discord will always share files with the highest number first in its name, so to brute-force the share order you can rename as shown;</p>
		  <ul class="txtli br">
		    <li><code>titleGame.02.png</code></li>
		    <li><code>titleUpd.01.png</code></li>
		    <li><code>titleDLC.00.png</code></li>

          <p>If you ever imagined about using your 3DS on your PC, well... <b>you can.</b> The overgrown asterisk in the room is the difference in processing power between consoles. If you are in possession of Nintendo's later "new" consoles you can do everything shown here. Else all you can do is use another controller attached to your PC, which may be beneficial for persons who dislike the 3DS' (lack of) ergonomics but still want to enjoy their titles.</p>
          <h2>Knowing the console's IP</h2>
          <p>As follows, perform these steps to enable reception of remote inputs and reveal the console's IP address:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Hold <code>L</code> and <code>Down</code> while pressing <code>Select</code> to cue Luma3DS' Rosalina menu. <ul>
                <li>If you had changed this key combination since, use whatever it was you assigned it to.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Select <code>Miscellaneous options</code>.</li>
            <li>Se;ect <code>Start InputRedirection</code>.</li>
            <li>Press <code>B</code> to back out until you see the console's IP address.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>With the IP address noted, you can begin installing utilities on the PC which can utilize this information to connect with the console.</p>
